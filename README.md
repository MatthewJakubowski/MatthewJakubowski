### Hi there, I'm Mateusz 👋

**Medical Analyst (15y) ➡️ AI Engineer & Python Developer**
I turned my laboratory discipline into code efficiency. Currently building adaptive learning systems and AI agents entirely on a mobile ecosystem.

#### 🧬 The #FromPipetteToPython Project
My journey from biological systems to digital neural networks.
* **Core Philosophy:** Active Recall & Engineering over "Magic Prompts".
* **Hardware:** 100% Samsung DeX (Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra).

#### 🤖 My AI Stack (The Gems)
I build custom Gemini Agents to accelerate learning and deployment:
* `Neuro-Python` - Code Logic & Optimization
* `Neuro-Architect` - System Design & Engineering
* `Genesis Protocol` - Advanced Reasoning Framework
* `English Master Mentor` - Language & Knowledge Integration
