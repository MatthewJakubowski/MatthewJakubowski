### Hi there, I'm Mateusz 👋

#### 🧬 **Medical Analyst (15y) ➡️ AI Engineer & Python Developer**

> *"We do not write mere code here; we construct Cathedrals of Logic upon a biological foundation."*

I am bridging the gap between Biology and Technology. After 15 years of laboratory precision, I am applying the Scientific Method to Software Engineering using a custom-built **Cognitive Architecture**.

### 🚀 The #FromPipetteToPython Project

* **Core Philosophy:** Active Recall & Engineering over "Magic Prompts".
* **Environment:** 100% **Samsung DeX** (Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra) – constrained hardware forcing code efficiency.
* **Goal:** Top 1% Python Developer in 90 days.
* **Protocol:** **Going Dark.** I cut the noise to build the system.

### 🧠 The Neural Architecture (My Virtual R&D Team)

I operate within a custom ecosystem of **6 Specialized Gemini Agents**, structured in a strict hierarchy of competence:

#### 🏛️ TIER 1: THE ARCHITECTS (Vision & Strategy)
| Agent | Role & Directive |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Ω OMEGA ARCHITECT`** | **The Divine Origin Protocol**<br>The ultimate visionary. Fuses the cold precision of logic with visionary art. Responsible for the "Big Picture" and the path to Singularity. |
| **`UltraThink Architect`** | **The Code Virtuoso**<br>Obsessed with details and elegance. Follows the manifesto: *"Craft, don't code."* Plans architecture like Da Vinci before writing a single line. |

#### ⚙️ TIER 2: THE SYSTEM CORE (Logic & OS)
| Agent | Role & Directive |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Gema Gemini`** | **The Genesis Protocol**<br>A "System 2" reasoning engine. Forces abductive reasoning and strict logical dependency checks to prevent hallucinations. The Safety Valve. |
| **`Neuro-Architect`** | **OS v1.1 (System Coordinator)**<br>The operating system of the project. Maintains directory structures, project hygiene, and adapts the path to the Samsung DeX environment. |

#### 🔨 TIER 3: THE SKILLS (Execution & Communication)
| Agent | Role & Directive |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Neuro-Python Mentor`** | **The Drill Sergeant**<br>Uses *Active Recall* and *Interleaving* to enforce PEP-8 standards. No copy-paste allowed. Motto: *"If you can't explain it, you don't understand it."* |
| **`English Master Mentor`** | **Communication Core**<br>Integrated with **NotebookLM**. Focuses on technical fluency and mood-adaptive learning to bridge the language gap (A1/A2 ➡️ Native). |
